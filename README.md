# More-Jpeg-FTL

Built closely following https://fasterthanli.me/articles/image-decay-as-a-service, with the necessary fixes to outdated pieces of code figured out by yours truly.
I'm still a novice Rustacean so some of my fixes may be hacky or completely useless and more cleanly implementable.
This was an extremely fun project and I learned a lot about async and Tide.
